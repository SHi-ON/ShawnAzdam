## What?!
I wrote a [Python script](https://github.com/SHi-ON/VaxCheckNYC) to check available COVID-19 vaccine appointments at vaccination centers in New York.
You can also get notified via email, if you set your credentials.


## Why?
This project is basically a response to the slow and tedious process of getting a COVID-19 vaccine appointment at the time that I wrote this script in New York City.


## Where?
You can clone the code [here](https://github.com/SHi-ON/VaxCheckNYC) on GitHub and follow the instructions in the repository.
